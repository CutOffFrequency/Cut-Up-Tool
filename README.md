**CUT** is an auto [Cut-up](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cut-up_technique) web application with three modes (currently):

* **Bowie**: Which sorts the input text into groups of 4 - 6 elements (separated by a space " "), then shuffles and returns
 
* **Yorke**: Which sorts the input text into groups (separated by a comma ","), then shuffles and returns
 
* **Random**: Which is self explanatory

Simply paste or enter text directly into the input field, select a mode (default is random), then click the Cut & Shuffle button to rearrange the text

Further Cut / Shuffle events are simplified by clicking the Swap Text button which moves the results of the output field into the input field

Try experimenting with different modes and see what comes out!
