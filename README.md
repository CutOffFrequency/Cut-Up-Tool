CUT is an auto cut up web app with has three modes (currently):

 Bowie: Which sorts the input text into groups of 4 - 6 elements (separated by a space " "), then shuffles and returns
 
 Yorke: Which sorts the input text into groups (separated by a comma ","), then shuffles and returns
 
 Random: Which is self explanatory
 
Simply paste or enter text directly into the input field indicated, select a mode (default is random), then click the Cut & Shuffle button

Further Cut / Shuffle events are made easier by clicking the Swap Text button which moves the results of the output field into the input field
