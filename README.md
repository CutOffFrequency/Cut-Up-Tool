**CUT** is an auto [Cut-up Technique](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cut-up_technique) web application 

**Why use the cut-up technique?**

Various authors, lyricists and poets have used this technique to gain insight or new perspectives on a situation or source material. I would not suggest going "Naked Lunch" and using this technique to arrange a work, but instead as a method of finding ideas or inspiration
I recommend using anything you can get your hands on ... news clippings, journal entries, a dream diary, unfinished poetry, a paragraph from a novel you like, lyrics or poetry that have some significance to you or anything that evokes a feeling or idea that you wish to explore

**CUT** has the following modes:

* **Bowie**: Which sorts the input text into groups of 4 - 6 elements (separated by a space " "), then shuffles and returns
 
* **Yorke**: Which sorts the input text into groups (separated by a comma ","), then shuffles and returns
 
* **Random**: Which is self explanatory

Simply paste or enter text directly into the input field, select a mode (default is random), then click the Cut & Shuffle button to rearrange the text

Further Cut / Shuffle events are simplified by clicking the Swap Text button which moves the results of the output field into the input field

Try experimenting with different modes and see what comes out!
